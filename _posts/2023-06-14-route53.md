title: How to give your Github Pages blog a custom domain
description: Configuring AWS Route 53 Domain to Point to Github Pages
---

# Overview

<br>

# Steps

## AWS

1. Go to AWS Route 53, and click on "Hosted zones". 

2. Click on "Create record". 

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/createRecord.jpg)

3. Create a subdomain in "Record name". Change the "Record type" to CNAME. CNAME creates an alias that maps one domain name to another domain. Finally, in the "Value" section, enter your Github URL in the form of: `<username>.github.io`. **Be sure to omit the link to your repository**. 

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/details.jpg)

4. Click on "Create records". Your record should look something like this:

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/record.jpg)

## Github Pages

1. Create a Github pages repository and click on "Settings".

2. In the sidebar, click on "Pages". Under "Build and deployment", ensure that the Github Pages is being built from the main branch. If you forked nighthawkcoders/student, you might need to specify that before you can move on to Step 3.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/deploy.jpg)

3. Enter the domain you configured in Hosted zones.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/customDomain.jpg)

Github pages will run a DNS check. Once the check is successful, access your Github pages with your new domain name (ex: lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com). The domain should redirect to your Github Pages blog.

**Troubleshooting**: If the check is unsuccessful, check to see that you did the "AWS" steps properly. Also check to see if you spelled the domain correctly in Github Pages. If that does not work, delete the record in AWS and create it again. (It took me multiple times to get it to work, even though I typed the correct domain name. So if you encounter this error, you may have to be patient.)

## Troubleshooting

### Accessing the custom domain name returns a default Nginx page

While accessing the custom domain for the first time, you may encounter the default Nginx message or the default page for whatever web server was used instead of Github Pages:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nginxDefault.png)

This issue may occur if you had accessed the custom domain in your browser before you configured it in Github Pages. 

I tried refreshing the page multiple times, but the message persisted. Even after twelve hours, the message was still there. I then opened up the "Network" tab in Chrome Dev Tools, and reloaded the page. For some reason, the Nginx message changed to my Github Pages.

I'm not sure if this solution always works, so a backup method is to open up another browser and paste the custom domain into the search bar. This issue probably has something to do with the browser's cache.
