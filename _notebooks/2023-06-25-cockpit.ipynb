    "Cockpit is a tool that provides a GUI interface on the web. It allows an administrator to manage applications and services running on the server. While Linux configurations are mostly done through a command line, Cockpit provides a helpful visualization for features such as CPU and memory utilization. Cockpit also provides a terminal on the web interface, making it helpful if you need to access the server remotely. "
