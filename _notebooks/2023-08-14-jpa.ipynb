    "\n",
    "While coding in Spring Boot, it is very likely that at some point you'll encounter errors that'll prevent you from being able to run your backend. While coding in Spring for this blog, I encountered many error messages while creating my class and JPA repository. Here are a tip that I have to try to fix these errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your terminal window is long enough to view the entire error message. When I first learned `findByAContaining(String b)`, I thought that it would also work for other data types, such as int. So, I declared `findByAContaining(int b)` in the JPA repository. When I ran Spring, this was wall of text that I encountered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jpa-lesson-images/walloftext.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The error message was so long that it couldn't fit in my terminal, so I couldn't see the top part of the error message. I ended up pasting the error message that occurred towards the middle of the output (similar to the the message next to the blue text in the picture) and spending a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on. In the end, I couldn't find anything to help me fix the problem, and that's because the error messages in the middle aren't useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "    **The most helpful error message is at the beginning**. To be able to see the beginning of the error, it helps to expand your terminal. As seen in the picture below, the important part of the error message appears right at the beginning. The \"Spring\" banner is very helpful in marking where the error message starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jpa-lesson-images/largeterminal.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Copy the error and paste it into Google. ChatGPT is also a helpful tool, but it's best to verify it by Googling. I've asked ChatGPT to explain some Spring Boot concepts, but found that there were some wrong information after double checking with Google. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Research. Look at StackOverflow posts where people have had similar errors. Usually, you'll learn something new after discovering how to fix the bug. Troubleshooting helps me understand the code better, because it kind of \"forces\" me to research what the code does so that I have a better idea of what may cause the error. For instance, while researching this error, I learned that derived queries are an abstraction for JPQL queries, and I learned about Hibernate and ORM. Researching about JPQL helped me understand more about SQL, which inspired me to write this blog. Troubleshooting can be time consuming and requires patience, but I think the understanding gained after figuring out the solution makes the amount of time spent worth it.\n"
