    "`findBy<Attribute>` finds the column that is associated with the attribute. For example, when Spring sees `findByLastName`, it will look at the column that is associated with `LastName`. Note that SQL tables and Java have different naming conventions. When declaring a variable in Java, an uppercase letter is used to symbolize a space (ex: `lastName` for last name). In an SQL table's column names, spaces are separated by a \"_\". \n",

    "`findByLastName` tells Spring to look at the `last_name` column in the user database. Spring will then return the users that have the requested last name in a list. Something to note here is that the first letter of the attribute is capitalized. In this case, the \"l\" in `findByLastName` is capitalized. This tells Spring to look for the attribute `lastName`. The Spring Data JPA [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-property-expressions) provides an interesting read on how Spring determines the attribute in the query method.
